        <h2>Introduction</h2>      
        <p>Tierra Monte and Valley View Acres are small communities nestled in the foothills of Juan Tabo Canyon.<br><br>
           The purpose of this website is to preserve information regarding the development 
            of this area, as well as, the history of the area.</p>

        <h2> Location</h2>
        <p>Tierra Monte and Valley View Acres are located east of the intersection of Tramway and Forest Road 333. 
        To drive to Tierra Monte and Valley View Acres turn on Forest Road 333 off of Tramway, travel approximately 
        1 mile, and then take a right on Tierra Monte Dr. The community is north of the Tram which opened for
        operation on May 7, 1966.  Note in the 1960s Tramway was still a two lane dirt road.

        <h2> Plat</h2>
        <p> The below plat map encompasses Tierra Monte and Valley View Acres. It should be noted that this area 
            was primarily derived from two homesteads that existed in the early 1900s. The homesteads are discussed in
            more detail under the "History-Homesteads" tab.  Looking at the homestead plats under this tab you can 
            see the current plat boundaries follow the two homestead plats. Eight markers would define the two 
            homestead boundaries and these are discussed in detail under the "History-Homestead Markers" tab.

        <h2>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</h2>
        <p>The United States acquired the territory that is now the State of New Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, ending the war with Mexico. This treaty recognized the Spanish Land Grants previously in place.  It was not until 1912 that New Mexico became a state.</p>

        <h2>Original Land Homesteads in Tierra Monte</h2>
        <p>
            <span>The act of Congress May 20, 1862, “To Secure Homesteads to Actual Settlers on the Public Domain” was the 
            basis of two patents related to claims that make up Tierra Monte. To make a claim, homesteaders paid a filing 
            fee of $18: a $10 fee to make a temporary claim on the land, $2 for commission to the land agent and an additional
            $6 final payment to receive an official patent on the land. Land titles could also be purchased from the government
            for $1.25 per acre following six months of proven residency.  Additional requirements included five years of 
            continuous residence on the land, building a home on it, farming the land and making improvements. A homesteader 
            was eligible for up to 160 acres. <br><br>
            
            The two claims that makeup the Tierra Monte area were established and consisted of H.E. Survey No. 276 
            to Soloman Chavez and H.E. Survey No. 275 to Juan Chavez with a total acreage of only 79.5 acres. 
            These were recorded under Patent Numbers 848125 and 773918, respectively.  They were signed by Presidents 
            Warren G Harding on 2/19/1922 and Woodrow Wilson 9/20/1920, respectively.  They were both filed for record on 
            10/27/1949. Both embraced a portion of, approximately, Section 2 Township 11 north of Range 4 east of 
            the New Mexico Meridian. It is assumed that the two Chavez's with the adjacent homesteads were related. 
            The surveyor listed their addresses as Alameda, New Mexico and noted that Alameda was 7 miles away. One 
            unanswered question is why did these homesteaders not claim more land?  Did they purchase the land titles 
            at $1.25 per acre so the cost was a limiting factor?<br><br>

            Detailed information from surveyor, C. A. Long, who in 1916 surveyed the homesteads in Section 2 Township 11 
            north of Range 4 east of the New Mexico Meridian, can be found under Surveys in website,

        <h3>Homestead Notes and Homesteads Outside of Tierra Monte</h3>
        <p>
            <span>
                The surveyor notes on homesteads 275 and 276 states that each site had an adobe house, a rock wagon shed, 
                and a pole corral for goats. The location of these structures is indicated on each plat. Per the surveyor 
                each site was suitable for raising around 100 goats. Springs supplied water for both the household and the
                livestock. It is of interest to note that the surveyor in 1916 estimated the land improvements: the house,
                wagon shed, and corral, to be $200 for each homestead.

                The picture below is believed to be the remains of the rock wagon shed for homestead 275.

            <span>
                In addition, the surveyor notes that there is no U.S.L.M. available with the prescribed limits, so the surveyor establishes
                U.S.L.M. No. 1 Sandia on a rocky ridge bearing East and West.  This is established on a granite rock 20 feet
                in diameter and 10 feet high. Detailed information about this reference point is given under the surveyor 
                notes for claim 268. Claims 268, 270, 275, and 276 all reference a direction and distance from U.S.L.M. No. 1.
                The rock pictured below pointed to by the arrow is believed to be the reference rock the surveyor used.

        <h2>Understanding the Homestead Surveys</h2>
        <p>
            <span>Township surveys were introduced after 1782 and in New Mexico Township surveying began in 1855 when the 
                New Mexico Principal Meridian was adopted. Plat maps from survey numbers 275 and 276 show dimensions in chains 
                (Gunter's chain). One chain is 66 feet long consisting of 100 links and each link in the chain is 7.92 inches.
                A township is 6 miles on each side and divided into 36 sections each being 1 mile by 1 mile. Claim numbers 275 
                and 276 fall under Township 11 section 2. Township sections are numbered as follows: 
                <table>
                    <tr><td>6</td>	<td>5</td>	<td>4</td>	<td>3</td>	<td>2</td>	<td>1</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>7</td>	<td>8</td>	<td>9</td>	<td>10</td>	<td>11</td>	<td>12</td></tr>

            North of the La Cueva Picnic Grounds road there is a marker that specifies the boundaries of Township 11 sections 2,3,10, and 11. 
            This marker pictured below is located at latitude 35° 12' 10.8"N, longitude 106° 28' 52.8W (35.203, -106.498).

            <span><b>Differences between Latitude and Longitudes</b><br>
                In the 1916 survey the surveyor went off of the Reconnaissance Map of San Pedro Quadrangle map.  
                This map in 1916 most likely used the Clarke 1866 spheroid representation of earth. Current GPS coordinates 
                used by google photo uses a WGS84 datum.  Because of the difference in datums the surveyor documented 
                latitude and longitudes did not match the latitude and longitudes associated with the google photos 
                of the markers. 
                
                Example of the difference is seen in the surveyor notes regarding the starting latitude and longitude 
                for Corner 1 in claim 276 versus the google photo of the same corner.  The surveyor documents has 
                latitude 35° 11' 25" N and the longitude 106° 29' 06" W. Google photos has the latitude at 35° 12' 25.2" N 
                and longitude at 106° 28' 51.6" W. Note: one minute of latitude is equal to 1.15 miles and one second of 
                longitude is 80 feet. That meant to determine where the markers were via GPS, calculations needed 
                to be done from a known good GPS point.

            42 which designated this area and a large portion of the west face of the Sandia Mountains to be managed
             by the Forest Service as part of the Sandia Mountain Wilderness area.

        <h2>Water and Water Rights in Tierra Monte</h2>

            <span><b>Spring Boxes</b><br>
                Originally two spring boxes located on lot #42 supplied the Valley View and Tierra Monte area.  
                Later Tierra Monte had a water system installed that consisted of several wells with holding tanks 
                while Valley View residents drilled private wells. The original spring boxes supplied water to at 
                least lot #42 and lot #3 at one time. The picture below shows the two spring boxes that still 
                exist in the area.

            <span><b>Water Rights</b><br>
                Bruce Cantrell in November of 1967 had the first well drilled in the area under permit number RG-15341.<br><br>
                On November 22, 1971, the Tierra Madre Corp, Inc, conveyed all water rights under state permit
                number RG-12871-CF to Mrs. Joan Cantrell, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Bruce Cantrell gave a 
                Bill of Sale dated the 28th of July 1975 in which all right, title, and interest in the water 
                system described as the Tierra Monte Water System, including, well, pipes and tanks were deeded 
                to Tierra Monte Water Users Association (TMWUA). On August 10, 1975 Mrs. Joan Cantrell subsequently
                conveyed the same water rights to the TMWUA. <br><br>
                On June 18, 1990 a certificate of incorporation of the Tierra Monte Water Users Incorporated was signed 
                by George Franklin, Jerry Berger, A.J. Ferrara, David McCarty, and Fred Seebinger. A board of directors 
                consisting of five members that are elected biennially in staggered terms of four years each
                is defined in the Articles of Incorporation documentation.<br><br>
                <b>Uranium Treatment Center</b><br> In the 1990s the NM Environment Department (NMED) started listing 
                uranium as a contaminent with maximum levels for compliance. The EPA standard for compliance was 
                specified as 30 parts per billion(ppb). Beginning in 2007 TMWU board worked on reconfiguring the 
                well controls such that the lower unranium wells pumped more water. This strategy worked 
                for the community until 2013 when several violations of the compliance occured. Thus in August 
                of 2015 the TMWUA board hired a professional engineering firm Martin/Martin to
                design a treatment system using an absorption/filtration system in media tanks. The 10ft x 18ft
                building by the mailboxes that houses the treatment system was built in 2016 where an original 
                well house was located. When the treatment system was installed it was expected that the tanks
                would need to be swapped every 5 to 10 years and the only company that performed this service was 
                Waste Remediation Technology (WRT). Over the course of two years, 2015 and 2016, Gary Fishman
                was able to secure 280K of infustructure improvement capital outlay grant money from the state so that 
                Tierra Monte water would be in compliance with the safe drinking requirements. Ken Bergeron served as 
                president of the TMWUA from 1999 until 2017 to ensure successful completion of this uranium 
                removal system under his tenure.<br><br>
                <b>Current Water System in Tierra Monte</b><br>
                As of January of 2025 Tierra Monte water comes from groundwater drawn from three active wells within 
                the subdivision.  The water goes through a uranium treatment system that is located in the building 
                shown below by the mailboxes. The water is also disinfected using chlorine as it goes through the 
                treatment center.<br><br>

        <p>
            <span> After the water is pumped and run through the uranium mitigation system it is stored in three tanks 
                located in the northeastern corner of Tierra Monte lot #11. Each tank holds approximately 9000 gallons of water.
                In addition, the tanks have a spray system that can be used to allow radon to escape into the atmosphere. 
                From the tanks the water is fed through a gravity fed distribution system of in-ground pipes to 
                Tierra Monte residents. Because the water is a gravity fed system houses closest to the tanks have      
                low water pressure while houses farther down the hill from the tanks have very high water 
                pressure. It was not until around 1996 that water meters at each house were installed. Prior to
                the meters being installed a flat water rate was charged to each household. By the early 2000s 
                digital controls were put in place on the wells so the TMWUA board members could monitor and control
                the pumping.<br><br>

                Well 2 pictured below is located by the storage tanks and contains the lowest-uranium amount as
                such the water from this well does not go through the uranium mitigation system and goes directly 
                to the tanks where it is mixed with the water from the other wells.

        <h2>Building in Tierra Monte</h2>
        <p>
            <span>Building in the Tierra Monte community began in 1954 and by 1971 when Charles R.(Bob) Hutchins' family 
                moved into #3 there were only 5 houses in the area. In July of 1976 there were 9 residences in the area 
                connected to the water system  (Smylie(#25),  Hutchins (#3),  Poxon (#14),  Seebinger(#41), Banek(#1), 
                Rozum(#2), Menk(#5), Fox (#33) and Beerman & Shaffer(#21)).  Note: Developers, Beerman & Shaffer owned 
                numerous vacant lots. Dave McCarty owned lot #42 but was not connected to the water system at 
                this time.<br><br>

                On February 9, 1973, the Cantrell v. Lawyers Title Insurance Company lawsuit was served. 
                This lawsuit dealt with the fact that the land the Cantrell's believed that they purchased 
                from the Westphall's consisted of 1.9 acres less than what they were led to believe they were
                getting.  The Cantrell's believed the land they purchased extended to the forest service fence 
                when it actually did not. 35.103 acres appears to be the acreage the Cantrell's purchased. This
                area probably excluded lots that were already developed, like McCarty's, Hutchins, etc. It appears
                that the Cantrell's were compensated $3,420.00 for the 1.9 acre issue.<br><br>
  
                On July 27, 1979, a lawsuit of Virgil Wilson and Beulah MyRee Wilson vs. Falls Land & Development 
                Corp vs Joan Cantrell sued for access to Valley View Acres across lots 11&12. The stipulation of 
                the lawsuit was that those living in Valley View Acres were to maintain this road. This was filed 
                on December 18, 1979.<br><br>

        <h2>1987 Draft Pueblo Claim Submitted – 1988 Conclusion was 1858 survey was not fraudulent or grossly erroneous</h2>
        <p>
            <span>In 1987 the Pueblo of Sandia claimed that approximately 10,000 acres of land had been excluded from a 
                patent issued to the Pueblo by the United States because of an 1864 surveyor error (US Department of 
                Interior Memorandum dated 12/9/1988). Reference map of claimed area. <br><br>
                The United States acquired the territory that is now the State of New Mexico through the Treaty of 
                Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, ending the war with Mexico. The Sandia Pueblo was unique in 
                that it still had its official Spanish grant documents from 1748.  The translated Spanish grant documents
                translated by David Whiting were submitted to Congress.  Congress on December 22, 1858 confirmed the 
                Pueblo's claim. Spanish pueblo land grants granted a “formal pueblo” as “one league from each corner of 
                the church..”  A league is approximately 2.6 miles. The grant was surveyed by Clements in September 21, 1859,
                as 24,000 acres with one third of this as first rate bottom land easily irrigate and cultivated. President 
                Abraham Lincoln issued a patent on November 4, 1864 to the Sandia Pueblo as the survey was completed and approved.<br><br>

                The Sandia Pueblo had been abandoned during the Pueblo revolts of 1680-1696. Friar Juan Miguel Menchero 
                petitioned Governor and Captain General of New Mexico to relocate Moqui converts to the abandoned site. 
                On April 5, 1748, Lieutenant General Don Bernardo du Bustamante was commissioned to establish the Pueblo.  
                On May 16, 1748 Lieutenant General Bustamante performed the rituals then associated with a grant from Spain
                as memorialized in a document known as the Act of Possession. The western border was measured at only 
                .5 leagues because of the Rio Grande River.  To compensate for the western border being less than a league 
                the north and south were extended to 1.48 leagues. Reference the standard league versus the modified league
                in the north and south directions.  In the US Department of Interior Memorandum dated December 9, 1988 the 
                conclusion was that the Pueblo of Sandia had not met its burden of demonstrating by preponderance of the 
                evidence that the 1858 survey was fraudulent of grossly erroneous. This Memorandum was written by 
                Solicitor Ralph Tarr and accepted by Secretary of Interior, Donald Hodel.

        <b>1994 Pueblo Claim Resubmitted</b>
        <p>
            <span>
                In 1994 Sandia Pueblo sued the US Forest Service over the land claim.<br><br>

                On December 10, 1996 United States District Judge, Harold Green, allowed the Pueblo to circumvent statutes of 
                limitation over suing the US Forest Service and on July 20, 1998 he filed an order (Civ No 94-2624) that ordered
                the 1988 Memorandum be Vacated along with other instructions. Shortly after Judge Green’s order was filed, 
                the Pueblo published fliers that were distributed to government officials in Washington, DC, landowners in the 
                claim area, and others. Mediation between the Pueblo, Tram Company, Federal Government, County, City and 
                landowners also began after the orders were issued but in the fall of 1999 they came to a standstill. The 
                Pueblo, Tram Company, and the Federal Government continued to work on a draft settlement document. When 
                presented to the City, County, and landowners, they did not agree with the settlement. In early April 2000 
                the US Forest Service announced this settlement even though all parties did not agree. One of the disputed 
                issues was the language that was unequal when referring to the different interested parties. For example when 
                the Pueblo's rights were described the words "recognize and protect" were used but when referring to the publics 
                "use and enjoyment of the area," the agreement used the words "respect and assure". The unequal protection 
                wording was disputed because this could have been problematic in any future litigation or interpretation of 
                the law.<br><br>

                Dr. Stanley Hordes, former Historian for the State of New Mexico, in 1996 put out a report, History of the 
                Boundaries of the Pueblo Sandia (1748-1860), concluding the Pueblo received more land that it was entitled 
                under the 1748 Spanish land grant. This report can be found at

        <p> 
            <span>All around Tierra Monte is evidence of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) work projects.  Stan Cohen in his 
            Tree Army book, states that more than 32,300 men from New Mexico were enrolled in the CCC and more than 
            54,500 men served in the state.  In this book he notes averages of 32 camps a year were operated with a total 
            financial obligation within the state of more than $63,370,000. The Juan Tabo and La Cueva picnic ground areas 
            were established by the CCC.<br><br>

            In Dirk Van Hart's book, Camps and Campsites of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in New Mexico 1933-1942, 
            there is a picture (reference scanned page below from this book) of the CCC campsite at Tramway and Forest Road 
            333.

                There were at least five medallion trees around Tierra Monte.  These older trees had core
                samples taken from them and analyzed and then based on the estimated year of germination 
                they had metal medallions inserted with names that related to a historic event or person 
                associated with the germination time frame.  Sometime prior to 2024 the Oliver Wendell Holmes, 
                Jr. medallion tree located at latitude and longitude 35.211, -106.474 died.

                The Robinson Crusoe Tree located at latitude and longitude 35.212, -106.467 fell
                over after dying and no longer has a medallion attached but the P. T. Barnum Birth tree
                located at latitude and longitude 35.211, -106.480, pictured below is still alive 
                with the medallion. It is not known who collected the tree samples and put in the 
                medallions but Carl Gervais believes it was the CCC.

            Doc Victor Westphall (1913-2003) who with his wife, Jeanne (1915-2004), built the Vietnam 
            Veteran's Memorial  in Angel Fire, New Mexico to honor their son, Victor David Westphall 
            (1940-1968), a marine killed in action in Vietnam on May 22, 1968, also built two houses 
            in Tierra Monte.  In 1960 Westphall built the houses at 1101 and #3.<br><br>

            Tom Smylie (1937-2023) who lived on lot #25 for many years bred peregrines and had large 
            bird cages around his house.  His efforts contributed to the removal of the species from 
            the endangered list.<br><br>

            1984 Sam Poxon who lived in the house at #14 kept a locked cable across the road in this 
            area.<br><br> 
            
            It should be noted that when Harald Mueller(1940-2003) and his wife Kathy had the house 
            at 1104 La Luz Trail built, they used 1 Germania Lane as their address. Harald and Kathy 
            owned the Rio Rancho Inn from 1986 to 1998.<br><br>

            Gary Johnson who served as Governor of the State of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003 in

        Debra Hutchins would like to thank her husband, Jim, and his entire family for 
        introducing her to the beautiful area of Tierra Monte. Debra and Jim moved to Tierra 
        Monte when they built their house in 1991. Jim's family (his parents, Bob and Gene, 
        and his 4 siblings) moved to Tierra Monte in 1971. It is a wonderous area with access 
        to fabulous hiking trails, abundant wildlife, vast views, and rich history.<br><br>
     
        Debra would like to thank her hiking buddy, Charlie, for showing her the many 
        intriguing features of the Tierra Monte area and being patient as she attempted to 
        take pictures for documentation. Most of the features in this posting would 
        have not been noticed had it not been for her guide, Charlie.<br><br>

        A big thanks to Teresa the resident wildflower expert who has taken the time to lead 
        hikes in order to point out and identify beautiful blooming flora in the area.<br><br>
                
        Debra's goal in posting this is to preserve information regarding the development 
        of the area, as well as, the history of the area. She has tried to accurately convey 
        this information and hopes that others will find the content informative and 
        interesting.
